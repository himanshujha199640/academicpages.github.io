Hello!


This year again I have been selected for [Google Summer of Code 2019 @ Linux Foundation](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/projects/#5358212549705728)
under the mentorship of [Lukas Bulwahn](https://github.com/bulwahn). The project is an experimental research analysis
of applying Clang Thread Safety Analyser on the linux kernel to find potential concurrency
related problems by suitably annotating the source code. The analysis is completely static
and reports warnings at compile time.

The project falls under the umbrella of [Enabling Linux In Safety Applications(ELISA)](https://elisa.tech/),
a recently announced project by Linux Foundation.

I will be working closely with ClangBuiltLinux community and you can join us too by
subscribing the [clang-built-linux](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/clang-built-linux) or
take a peak at the [archives](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/clang-built-linux).

Clang Thread Safety analysis hasn't been implemented in any opensource project where I could
take references. Although, Google claims to deploy this feature on wide scale internally on
over > 20,000 C++ files with more than 140,000 annotations increasing every day!

Marc-Andr√© Lureau had [proposed](http://lists.nongnu.org/archive/html/qemu-devel/2017-07/msg00793.html)
this feature for the QEMU codebase to do some sort of 
"context-checking" and prevent any misuse. Kind of enforcing policies that one shouldn't
call a function from a non-privilege context. It didn't get merged into the codebase
nor was any development in that given direction though it is marked as a WIP.

Some ideas one might try to play around could be:

* Can we use this feauture to check we don't sleep while holding a lock ?
* Ensuring `GFP_ATOMIC` is passed during an allocation in a coroutine which might sleep ?
...

But currently, my main goal is to find cocurrency bugs such as race conditions, deadlocks,
 etc. in a multi-threaded environment.
